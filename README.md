# catan-logger-react

I am creating this project to deploy using Azure.

It will allow my friends and I to keep track of stats for the Catan games we play every week.

It is hosted at https://catan-logger.azurewebsites.net.

The API is hosted at https://catan-logger-api.azurewebsites.net using .NET Core 6.0. 

This will also be using a SQL Server database that is host by Azure.
