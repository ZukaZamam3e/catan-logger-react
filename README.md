# catan-logger-react

I am creating this project to deploy using Azure.

It will allow my friends and I to keep track of stats for the Catan games we play every week.

It is hosted at https://catan-logger.azurewebsites.net.

The API is hosted at https://catan-logger-api.azurewebsites.net using .NET Core 6.0. 

This is also using a SQL Server database that is hosted by Azure.

Source code is hosted in Azure DevOps with CI/CD pipelines deploying to an Azure App Service. 

I will update this code periodically.
